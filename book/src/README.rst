Clean Code in Python
--------------------
Code for the book 'Clean code in Python', second edition.

Requirements
============
The code in this repository can be run directly in a local machine, provided some dependencies are met (explained in the
next section).  Alternatively, a Docker image is provided, which can be used to interact directly with.

Running it locally
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The code in this repository assumes Python 3.9+ is installed in the system, and that ``python3.9`` is available in the
current path.

    - Python 3.9+
    - GNU make and building tools for the dependencies (gcc, python3 dev files, etc.)

Docker
^^^^^^
A docker image is provided to make it simpler for readers to try out the code examples.
You can obtain the image, and interact with it by running::

    docker pull rmariano/ccip:latest
    docker run -it rmariano/ccip:latest

Setup
=====
To install the dependencies, run::

    make setup

This will create a new virtual environment, called ``.env`` and install the dependencies on it. From this point, you
need to activate the virtual environment to run the rest of the code examples. The environment is activated by running::

    source .env/bin/activate

Each chapter has its corresponding directory given by its number.

Inside each chapter directory, tests can be run by::

    make test

This requires the ``make`` application installed (in Unix environments).
In environments without access to the ``make`` command, the same code can be
tested by running the commands on the ``Makefile``::

    python -m doctest *.py
    python -m unittest *.py
